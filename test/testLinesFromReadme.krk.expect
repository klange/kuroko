['', '**Kuroko** is a dynamic, bytecode-compiled programming language and a [dialect](#python-differences) of Python. The syntax features indentation-driven blocks, familiar keywords, and explicit variable declaration with block scoping. The runtime interpreter includes a tracing garbage collector, multithreading support without a global lock, and support for single-step debugging and bytecode disassembly. The full interpreter and compiler can be built on Unix-like platforms to a shared library of around 500K and is easy to embed and extend with a [clean C API](https://kuroko-lang.github.io/docs/embedding.html) and limited libc footprint. Kuroko has been successfully built for a wide range of targets, including Linux, [ToaruOS](https://github.com/klange/toaruos), WebAssembly, macOS (including M1 ARM devices), and Windows (with mingw64).', '', '## Build Kuroko']
